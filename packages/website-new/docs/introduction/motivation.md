# {{ $frontmatter.title }}

I used to love Mocha + Chai combo, but as time flew, I felt it's limiting. Other
projects like Jest shown that there is room for innovation in this space. With
last version published 2 years ago, Chai seems abandoned. Furthermore, as
TypeScript becomes more and more popular, it became evident that some things
about writing assertions could be improved. **earl** is an effort to bring a
little bit of innovation in the space of assertion libraries.

## Why not just Jest?

I really enjoy some of the Jest's features — that's what inspired this library
in the first place. However, I really hate others. Jest feels too
[magical](https://github.com/facebook/jest/issues/4414) and
[full](https://github.com/facebook/jest/issues/2441) of
[bugs](https://github.com/facebook/jest/issues/8688) for my taste. On the other
hand, I always enjoyed simplicity and confidence that Mocha provides.

Simply put, **Jest takes control away from you, Mocha puts you in charge**.
